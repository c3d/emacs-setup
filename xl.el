;;; Commentary:

;; Major mode for editing programs written in XL.

;; Successive TABs cycle between possible indentations for the line.
;; There is symbol completion using lookup in XL.

;;; Code:

;; It's messy to autoload the relevant comint functions so that comint
;; is only required when inferior XL is used.

  "Major mode for editing XL files.
Turns on Font Lock mode unconditionally since it is required for correct
parsing of the source.
See also `jython-mode', which is actually invoked if the buffer appears to
contain Jython code.  See also `run-xl' and associated XL mode
commands for running XL under Emacs.

The Emacs commands which work with `defun's, e.g. \\[beginning-of-defun], deal
with nested `def' and `class' blocks.  They take the innermost one as
current without distinguishing method and class definitions.  Used multiple
times, they move over others at the same indentation level until they reach
the end of definitions at that level, when they move up a level.
\\<xl-mode-map>
Colon is electric: it outdents the line if appropriate, e.g. for
an else statement.  \\[xl-backspace] at the beginning of an indented statement
deletes a level of indentation to close the current block; otherwise it
deletes a charcter backward.  TAB indents the current line relative to
the preceding code.  Successive TABs, with no intervening command, cycle
through the possibilities for indentation on the basis of enclosing blocks.

\\[fill-paragraph] fills comments and multiline strings appropriately, but has no
effect outside them.

Supports Eldoc mode (only for functions, using a XL process),
Info-Look and Imenu.  In Outline minor mode, `class' and `def'
lines count as headers.
