;; Commentary:

;; This is the first release, expect more in the next and feel free to
;; feed me with patches, wishes, bugs and whatever you you think will
;; worth it.

;; This mode is for counting times. I basically created it because I
;; used to cook pizza while coding and I used to forget the time and a
;; few minutes later I could smell a burned pizza. The result of this
;; is displayed in pictures, right here:

;; http://www.marcelotoledo.org/fotos/2003/pizza_queimada

;; You can use it for whatever purpose you like, but the typical
;; scenario is to keep alerted of how much time has past.

;; To make it available for Emacs, put it in your `load-path' and
;; insert (require 'chronometer) in your .emacs.

;; Use `chronometer' to start the chronometer, it will automaticaly
;; start from zero and will keep incrementing every one second.

;; From now on you may want to play with the following keybindings:

;; * a - set alarm
;; * u - unset alarm
;; * p - toggle pause
;; * r - restart
;; * h - hide
;; * q - exit
;; * ? - help

;; TODO:

;; * stop/start
;; * count down (maybe)
;; * allow more input formats for the alarm
;; * make it unable to set alarm to less then the elapsed time is
;; * execute a command when reach alarm
;;
